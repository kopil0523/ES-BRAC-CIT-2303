The next thing we will discuss is comment,
comments are used to keep notes of a code so that another
programmer understand the code easily
There are three kind of Comments. They are: 
1.Inline Comment, 
2. Single Line Comment, 
3. Multiple line Comment

for example:
'''

print("It is raining")  # This is an example of inline comment

# Let's try single line comment. It is a single line comment

print("Anwar is a lawyer")

"""Now
this
is 
a
 multiple line 
 comment
 """

"""
print("Saheda is ready with her creations")
print("Her father is waiting for her performance.")
"""
print("Saheda's performance was excellent")
